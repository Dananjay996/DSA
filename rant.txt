This is getting crazy I'm not gonna lie lol Why is this shit getting crazier by the day man. I hate this genuinely and I do not ever wish for this to happen to any of my friends lmao.... What is this man? I do not like this at all and now my PC is taking a shit load of time to get started. Typical Windows lmao.. This is the whole reason I am considering a permenant switch to linux, kali especially. Oh my, now it is updating automatically. I just opened it to check my git auto commit shell script and now it wouldn't even work? Damn bro. Now I'm crazy fast at typing as well. I can't believe my eyes lol. I also ranted some random shit on X today. And my PC is still loading, nice. Am I just going to keep typing here until my PC loads? Who knows lol. I might. I really could be spending this time more efficiently but I'm not. And I don't want to. Windows is the shittiest OS of all time. It literally takes 10 minutes for my PC to start. It's actually crazy. Well had I done this shit in monkeytype I atleast would have a PB by now lol. My PB is 127 anyways. So maybe not. I also really have to practice DSA after this. I'm just trying to push all my code to github to keep track of my progress and honestly not lose a lot of touch commiting to github lol. That is the entire reasong why I am searching for the auto commit shell script lol. So it would increase my commit numbers. I really want to have an attractive git profile by the end of this vacation. People that I met at work do not even have a github profile. It's crazy. Oh, my pc booted finally. Bye, I guess.
